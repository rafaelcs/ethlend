[![image-to-ascii](http://i.imgur.com/Om8G7dZ.png)](#)

## :cloud: Installation

```sh
# Using npm
npm install --save image-to-ascii

# Using yarn
yarn add image-to-ascii
```


:bulb: **ProTip**: You can install the [cli version of this module](http://github.com/IonicaBizau/image-to-ascii-cli) by running `npm install --global image-to-ascii-cli` (or `yarn global add image-to-ascii-cli`).

Check out the [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) guide for more information.

## :clipboard: Example



```js
// Dependencies
const imageToAscii = require("image-to-ascii");

// The path can be either a local path or an url
imageToAscii("https://octodex.github.com/images/octofez.png", (err, converted) => {
    console.log(err || converted);
});

// Passing options
imageToAscii("https://octodex.github.com/images/privateinvestocat.jpg", {
    colored: false
}, (err, converted) => {
    console.log(err || converted);
});
```



In order to run the `webcam.sh` provided in the `example` folder, you will also need streamer. The script uses streamer to make webcam pictures and converts them into ASCII art using the `webcam.js`

```sh
# Ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install streamer

# CentOS / RHEL
$ sudo yum install --enablerepo epel GraphicsMagick
```


To run the script just use:

```sh
sh webcam.sh
```

## :memo: Documentation


### `imageToAscii(source, options, callback)`
Converts the provided image in ASCII art.

#### Params

- **String|Buffer** `source`: The path/url to the image or a Buffer object.
- **Object|String** `options`: The path to the image or an object containing the following fields:

 **Size Options**:
  - `pxWidth` (Number): The pixel width used for aspect ratio (default: `2`).
  - `size` (Object): The size of the result image (ASCII art)—interpreted by
    [`compute-size`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/compute-size):
    - `height` (Number|String): The height value (default: `"100%"`).
    - `width` (Number|String): The width value (default: computed value to
       keep aspect ratio). This is optional if the height is provided.
  - `size_options` (Object): The options for
    [`compute-size`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/compute-size):
    - `screen_size` (Object): The screen size (defaults to terminal width
    and height):
        - `width` (Number): The screen width.
        - `height` (Number): The screen height.
    - `px_size` (Object): The pixel size.
        - `width` (default: `1`)
        - `height` (default: `1`)
    - `preserve_aspect_ratio` (Boolean): If `false`, the aspect ratio will
      not be preserved (default: `true`).
    - `fit_screen` (Boolean): If `false`, the result size will not fit to
      screen (default: `true`).

 **Matrix asciifier options**:
  - `stringify` (Boolean): If `false`, the pixel objects will not be
    stringified.
  - `concat` (Boolean): If `false`, the pixel objects will not be joined
    together.

 **Pixel asciifier options**:

  - `pixels` (Array|String): An array or string containing the characters
     used for converting the pixels in strings
     (default: `" .,:;i1tfLCG08@"`).
  - `reverse` (Boolean): If `true`, the pixels will be reversed creating a
     *negative image* effect (default: `false`).
  - `colored` (Boolean): If `true`, the output will contain ANSI styles
    (default: `true`).
  - `bg` (Boolean): If `true`, the **background** color will be used for
    coloring (default: false).
  - `fg` (Boolean): If `true`, the **foreground** color will be used for
    coloring (default: true).
  - `white_bg` (Boolean): Turn on the white background for transparent
    pixels (default: `true`).
  - `px_background` (Object): An object containing the `r` (red), `g`
    (green) and `b` (blue) values of the custom background color.

 **Other options**:
  - `image_type` (String): Use this to explicitely provide the image type.
  - `stringify_fn` (Function): A function getting the `pixels` matrix and
    the `options` in the arguments. Use this option to implement your own
    stringifier.
- **Function** `callback`: The callback function.

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
